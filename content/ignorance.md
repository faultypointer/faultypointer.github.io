With communication now happens to be digital first, and social second, ignoring
has become a problem. While children grow up in a world where it is fine to ignore
texts and messages, those traits also follow to the real world. And since there is
an information overload the first thing to grasp someone's mind is validated so much
that it becomes the truth to that individual person, and no signs of crossthinking
and assuming there are alternatives and counterarguments.

Any criticizm seems like it is a personal attack to the persons beliefs. _I am just
what I am_ [_I like the way I am_] is the biggest excuse for people. [_Like, sure but that's what an animal
without a brain, [_(I mean conscience)_] would also think of itself._] Having a brain
means you can think and reason, because you'll be validated by the internet for almost
anything you think of and validation is like privacy nowadays. [_Just a concept._]

I am a tech guy. [_I must have repeated this phrase many times and will go on to do so._]
And I am very interested by how we can send data from one place to another in
different ways, and in speed. [_And by speed, I mean instantly_] and the fact that
these messages are ignored because, it doesn't matter, because, it's the norm now.
[_Message come and go, they doesn't matter._]

But, the problem isn't ignoring messages[_I do it too._],
the problem is ignoring questions. And it isn't just via the internet,
or messages. I see people just ignoring the person infront of them and not speaking and
just flat out refusing to acknowledge that the person exists in front of them. It's
ghosting but standing in front of the person and making them feel like a ghost [_someone
who doesn't exist_]. I see this in teenagers today and I know that __Juvenoya__ is a thing.

[_Man it feels bad to feel like a ghost._]

[_Lastly, nothing makes me furiating other than someone not replying to me when I ask something,
be it via texts or in real life._] [_Might also because I invest so much of time thinking
about communication software._]

[_Like, just say that you don't know if you don't know._] [_Not saying anything doesn't help!!!_]
