In my previous post titled [Exaggeration](/exaggeration) I said that I exaggerate things for the sake of letting others feel how I felt about it. Yes, editing pictures is kinda the same as exasurating the details and colors. [_By editing I mean only changing colors and cropping, not tampering with the picture itself._] I do it too, and I feel like it's fine to do so. But, posing and manipulating the events in order to make it look other than it actually is, isn't something I like.

We being digital citizens have always changed ourselves when we see a camera. From standing straight without moving in the past times when cameras were slow, to posing and smiling today, we have always changed for the camera. It has become an obvious thing to pose to a camera.

[_XD Actually, I initially started writing this article to criticize posing and manipulating the situation to capture a camera pleasing version of the subject but the truth._]

I understand that we humans crave attention and acceptance. By being accepted to a group/society is how we survived while evolving, making it the main trait of humans. So, it seems fair to make oneself look good [_or cool, or attractive, or beautiful_] when presenting to a social place [_/media_].

It's like the concept that if there were no laws against it, too many people would commit crimes. If people didn't have to, people wouldn't. But, my problem with it is that it changes the memories as it actually was, to something else. We almost never get "authentic" memories, because if there's a camera recording them, people change how they behave. [_Maybe surveillance isn't as bad as I think it is. XD I'm just joking, it's bad._]

This is a very long way to say that I like _candid_ pictures, you might think. Yeahh, sorta, but also, I like (to capture)/[_(the captures of)_] people as they are at the moment; smiling, dancing, even crying because that's when we show those emotions as we ourselves are.

[_This text was also supposed to be about how people never show their real self [_we  never present the real truth_] in the social media, and we should never take the pictures of social media as a reference for how the person is. [_It's merely a depiction of how they want to be  seen at that moment of their life._]_]

But all in all, it's justifiable to put pictures that "look" good instead of "truth" [_For society as well as for oneself._] because yes! I like to be accepted by people who think what I want to be is cool and yes! I like to remember my past as happy and beautiful, even if it really wasn't.

_Pictures will lie and can lie and will keep on lying, so I choose to meet people instead of their pictures._ To get a more human understanding of their personality. [_To know the people as they are._]

[_Look at me bouncing back and forth on my own opinion, maybe this is what being gray feels like, but I like it._]

If I were a superhero, I'd be called "grayzone". [_or "middleclass" or "brown" because I myself am neither white nor black._]
