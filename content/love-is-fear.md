If Friday the thirteenth is considered scary to be spent alone, I guess February the thirteenth would be the version 2.0 of it. [_Well if you feel lonely that is._] Let's come to the seriousness of the topic. [_Sike! did you think I'd be serious about it?_] But maybe I'll be. I am just starting to write this [_Breaking the forth wall?_]. I had thought of writing about this topic a while ago today, but I put it on _note to self_ and  now that I'm trying to write about it, I can't think much. I mean, the thing is,
> To love is to be in fear.

In the first phases, when you feel the things, you are in constant fear, do they even like you. Saying [_showing*, actually_] the love you feel, you're in fear, will they even consider you? Dating [_doing things together_], do they even like the way you do things? Final phase [_?_] do they even think that you are for them? Yeah, all of these if __YOU__ are in love.

The thing is it's not easy to know if someone with you actually loves you.` [_For me personally, the verbal expression of love, makes it more and more suspicious if they actually don't._] I mean maybe it's only me who feels like this but, not being able to know if someone actually does love you is a pain.

I hope tomorrow will be as regular as it can get. These thoughts have just been amplified by the fact that it's the "scary" February the thirteenth.

[_Well, I don't feel anything this valentine, it's a normal day without a meaning for me while it was different in the before years._]
