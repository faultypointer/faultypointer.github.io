__Note:__ _I don't have an audience, let alone international ones, but 'bhajans' are hindu songs about god._

I rarely talk about god. [_Except for when I am defending about it not existing._]
But, the fact that so many people believe in something without no proof at all also
makes sense. [_No, I don't see me turning into a theist anytime soon._] People can
just blame the all-powerful, almighty [_alknowledged?_] for their mistakes.
[_Now, that's an oxymoron._] Still, they do it because it calms them down.
[_Well, "god" isn't defending themselves for what they are accused of._]

Yeah! Yeah! People don't just blame god, they believe in them. They worship
them, they fear them, they wish to them, they rely on them. [_Someone who
feels like god is in their side will be more confident and energetic._]
But, In a sense, that is a good thing. How I understand it, that "god" is a
void where they can pour all their feelings at. [_God won't judge them feelings.
(How would they? First, they need to exist. XD)_]

This thought came to me this morning when I was bathing [_shower thoughts, huh?_] and my
dad had put bhajans on the TV. [_I don't think my dad believes in "god", he just plays
along. Or, at least he makes it seem like he doesn't care._] But something about the bhajans
just felt like nothing.

So, hear me out, I was listening to the bhajans while bathing and those didn't invoke
any feelings in me. It didn't have sorrow, or happiness, or greed .... nothing. It was
just words being sung about something that didn't exist, the voice didn't have to be soothing,
the words didn't have to mean something. [_For me as an atheist at least._] I know there are
praises and good things about god being told but when I put god out of the equation, it's
words that feel good but doesn't contain bias. [_I heard bhajans because it's a Hindu household
but it could have been anything sung for/about god, and it would just be praises and wishes._]
It's like listening to music [_(not songs)_], it means nothing but feels good.

I don't believe in reincarnations or magic or "something only god does and can do but has never done". But from the
social aspect of it, I think it's fine to be a theist. [_Which I didn't think previously (they're stoopid)._]
If you were told from birth that something feels good when it is done, and are constantly fed that
information, you'd develop a "feel good" response to that information even when it's not being "fed"
to you. [___Cultural Conditioning___]

God, as a belief, can be the antidote to existential crisis, and a hope to hold on to. The confirmation
bias aspect of it reinforces the feeling. If you wish for god to give you something that'll make you
happy at least once a day, you will confirm it when you are happy and conclude that god exists. Well,
god didn't have to exist if there was no sorrow, no pain, no "all the bad things that can happen".

I can't believe in something that is so unscientific, but at the same time the psychological aspect
of "god" has made it a good enough thing to keep existing.

[_I don't want to be lazy and wish for god to do it for me. But maybe it's the youth in me speaking,
I can justify not being able to do anything and believing in god. (It can be healthy in ways.)_]

[___I really did not think that I would reach such a conclusion, writing things out just fires up those
passive neurons. What can I say, \o/ My brain's a thinker.__ (and also a thinkerer. XD)_]
