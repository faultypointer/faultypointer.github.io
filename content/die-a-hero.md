To die a hero. This is overanalysing and over generalizing the term Hero. But I
see hero to be someone perfect, who knows every right way to do things. They have this perfect
status that they can do good in every condition in any state of their mind.

They say "Never meet your heroes." because, yes you are right, they are people too
and they are most likely to make mistakes. And when someone is exposed to only seeing
the best side, the goods, the perfects, it should be very disappointing to them to see
their heroes struggling just like they are.

Every moment when enjoyed will come to a sad end. The more happy you get, the more able
you'll be to be sad. Every sad event in life follows by a happy one and/or vice versa.
You save some time, you lose some time because of it. [_You automate a 2-minute process
to save time, and you end up losing a day._]

So, I think that is why they say, "__You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see
yourself as a villain.__" Because nothing is perfect, no-one is a hero forever. [_Unless they
die doing it and is the last thing they were known for._] To die a natural death always
brings up the chance that you die a villain [_And by a villain I don't mean someone who
does cruel things, it might just be someone who isn't able to live up to the growing standards._]

Every person has gone through drastic moments in their own way, they all have an image
that they successfully defeated their "villain" while living life. They all have one or
the other ability to influence someone's life in a good way, making them a hero to them.
And yet, they will never be able to sustain the status for forever.

Intent and Communication are vastly separated. [_I suppose that is why we expect aliens to
have telepathic abilities to communicate._] Words are lost in translation so much that a
good intent can be communicated badly. [_By, this I am not suggesting that every intent is
good and it's communication to blame._] One way or other a hero will die, but if they live
long enough, they might just understand why/how villains are born.
