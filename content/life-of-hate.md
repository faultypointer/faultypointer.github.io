The thing about hate is that it lasts as long as the person wants it to last.
I have learned to hate things [_I wasn't like this before_] and the more you
think about it the more hateful stuff you notice.

Take microsoft windows for instance, I haven't even used it nicely [_yeah I am a linux guy_] but
I know so many points [_reasons_] to hate it, and once I made my mind saying I hated it, I found more
and more things hate it even more.

Like __love__,  __hate__ is also a strong word. And it is __Heavy__. Like love, hate also loses
it's meaning if used too often and too many times. [_I have used "too" here, don't say that it doesn't,
too much of anything is bad._] And that is why I want the things I have to be small and meaningful
[_It's kinda like unblocking some people on `<your social media here>` because the blocklist is getting crowded._]
[_What do you mean you've never done it?_] .

Along with hating, forgiving is essential too. And letting people know what they have
done wrong to deserve hatred is one of the best things that can be done [_Also one of the
toughest thing though_]. So, the life of hate is as long as you want it to be and so is
the life of love. [_But we are talking about hate, here._]

Though I am talking about hate and love here, it isn't really binary. You can have a bit of
both in something like, I love NixOS [_It's a linux distro._] but I hate it because it sometimes
makes a simple things complicated. [_I mean, it'll be doable._] [_But, at what cost?_] [_Time!_]

Enough of this talking, I have work to do. Lastly, learning to hate is essential, because it
has a purpose and like love. [_I am feeling_] [_cringe_] [_while writing "love" but not "hate"._]

[_Love a little hate a little more. XD_]
