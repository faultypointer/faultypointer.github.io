Exaggeration is necessary sometimes. There are things worth sharing,
but sometimes [_actually, most fot he times_] they are boring.
Sometimes they can mean a lot to you, but may not be touching for
other people. So, to convey how you feel about something with the
same weight that you feel it, exaggeration is  necessary.

I consider myself a credible person while sharing facts, but when it
comes to my daily life, I add one to most of the things while telling
it to someone. Because, the exact thing that happened doesn't matter.
What matters is how you feel [_likee, you should feel how I felt when
living that moment._] about what I am saying. [_By, telling tthis
I might have lsot my credibility a little._] [_But, look I tell you the
truth._] [_It's not like I am lying to you._]

Okay, for instance, I would say that I solved like 10 bugs today, but in reality
I may have only solved 8 of them. [_Real life clickbait, I guess._] But, this is
a simple example. The amount I exaggerate is directly proportional to the way I
am feeling about it. [_Like, I would say that I hate someone, but in rality I might
just don't like them._] So yeah, that's the whole point I wanted to make. I feel
like I should not have made this point though.

[_Please don't subtract "two" from what I am saying, just because I said all this._]
[_I feel like you'd do that now._]

[_I only want you to feel it the way I felt it..._] [_( ^â—¡^)_]
