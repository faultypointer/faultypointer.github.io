This morning, I realized that the bag/sack of rice that is kind of a waste
product when buying rice, works as a garbage collecting bag for the month
which is tied and sent to the garbage truck. [_I never remember buying a sack
for the garbage, it's always there._] That got me thinking about
if there are other such things that I don't know. [_Sorry to disappoint, but
I didn't find any other. (Or, didn't think hard enough.)_]

But It got me thinking for sure. Got me thinking about relationships, symbiotes,
and what not. And since I am so fascinated by how humans behave the way they
behave. [_I am a human too. __Or, am I?___] I realized that in a relationship
[_Defined as having a mutual exchange of daily time and efforts. (Defined by myself
don't go looking for this definition on the internet.)_] we miss many things
that we take for granted because they just happen.

[_No, the clothes don't magically wash and dry themselves when you put them in the
basket. Your mom did that for you. (It isn't magic.)_]

As I was saying, we only know the importance of things when we suddenly don't have
it. When it doesn't exist and things goes sideways, you then realize its
importance. [_this is getting monotonous, the TL;DR is that I thought about
different things just because I realized that some things just sustain
themselves unknowingly._]
