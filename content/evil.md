So, I am using emacs now. And for a long time vim user, I am very evil.
My whole life has become an evil mess. I have exam [tomorrow](/tomorrow.md) and I am 
configuring emacs with my heart's content. Should get back to work now. I don't want 
to fail the exam.

I don't want this to remain an experiment because I am loving emacs, but it feels ever so
slightly sluggish than (neo)vim so, lets see. Also I have set up org and org-roam so, hopefully
I let emacs control my life instead of obsidian now.
