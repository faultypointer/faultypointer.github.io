This will probably sound weird but, I cry (almost) 80% of the times when a
movie ends. If not, at least once throughout the movie. [_And it is not like
I watch emotional movies, I do watch psychological thrillers, or just thrillers
in general too, but mostly comedy._] I sometimes think that my eyes are the problem, due to continuous
focus on a single place [_screen_]. But, It never happens when I generally scroll, or watch
YouTube videos for hours.

I do feel things, but not immediately, I need some time to process things to feel
what they should feel like. I feel like I have developed a response to it such that
whenever it is supposed to feel "an emotion" I feel it. And when it is something new
and I can't react. I will eventually feel it when I gather enough information on how too
feel about something. [_This means I can't be emotionally manipulated (Unless you already
know how I'll react to something.), but I can be manipulated to act emotionally.
(understand what I mean?)_]

I have always been told by my parents and also my relatives that I am a robot. [_They mean,
I act like one. __Or do they?___] I do things exactly as they are told to me and won't think
about something else that can be done while doing the thing I am tasked with. I feel the same
about my emotions, too. If I know that something should make me happy, I get happy. It's almost
an algorithm.

1. If I know how I should feel, I feel it. [_or, I try to feel it._]
2. If it is something new, I look toward my friends and react according to how they feel.
3. If it is something new and my friends aren't around, I react according to the surrounding majority.
4. If it is something new and my friends aren't around I can't figure out what to feel, I don't feel
   anything until, I think about it, research about it, find out what is wrong and what is right, then
   I start feeling the way I needed to feel.
5. If I am alone, and I am watching a movie, I just decide if the scene is supposed to be happy or sad And
   I start laughing out or crying accordingly. [_It happens so naturally that I just can't help it._]

Crying at a horror movie because the ghost had died and though it had killed a lot of people, you know that
that ghost was once a person with a family, had a life, went through tragedies and something made it be evil.

Or crying when the hero finally gets the girl and crying again when they break up. [_Yeah! It's not just the
sad moments I cry in, I do it in happy moments too._] Like, in Shashank Redemption when he escapes.

I generally prefer to watch comedies because of this. I just can't watch movies that depict a lot of emotions.

[_When I watched Inside Out and Inside Out 2 it was an awful experience, I had tears in my eyes all the time. (I love the movie.) But,
I just hate it because I cried when joy got angry, and when sadness was happy and when anger was calm and thoughtful, it was all over the place.
I like that about the movie, but the entire movie was about feelings feeling feelings that I was all tears throughout the blurred movie._]

[_"You just feel things, it's not like you think and feel." one might say. But, I don't (haven't/didn't) cry when things break,
people pass away, friends go away, someone I love leaves; Because I know that I should not feel things, that I should be "strong"._]

These reasons led me to science because they are only facts, and I don't have to decide on what to feel, think or say because
in science things are clear (mostly) and what it is supposed to be can be determined by how it's properties are defined (with the general truths).

[_hmmmmmm, science; almost a cult, eh? But, it's easier than acting human, I prefer being like a robot. :D_]
