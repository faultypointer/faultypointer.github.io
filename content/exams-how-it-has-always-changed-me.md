Exams before were not as horror as I feel them now [_Engineering? Prolly not just it._].
Though I always, and by always I mean always got sick when exams were near, I never really
was very bad at solving quiestions. [_I felt like I understood them and they were easy in
the class itself that I didn't really needed to study much during exams._]

Studying and memorizing things was never my forte but I got fine enough grades that I was
counted as one of the good students in the class. I was never brillient and never bad, I
didn't really study that much but I wasn't out of answers to write as well. I have always
been told that I can be excillent if I "study harder" but I never did.

I did get good grades so all my parents and relatives felt like I cound do something in
life that'd made me better than others. [_In other words, they felt like I would be
"sucessful"._] I still think that I am a good student and I can get good grades if I study.
But, the reality is different. I am addicted to ignoring the subjects if I have to give
exams on them.

The fact that I feel that I am someone who should get good grades and I am failing subjects
in the engineering course that I chose and love says so much about me and my study habit.
Which isn't a habit because I almost rarely "study". I explore the internet, I get facinated
by the people and things they can do, and wish that I could do those things too. But I am
afraid to try because if I feel like I failed when I put the effort the "Good Student" in mean
is going to die.

If I study and still fail the exams I would be someone dumb. I leave the possibility that if
I had studied I would have passed and the reason I failed is that I hadn't studied. Though I
can write about and and am conscious about it, I have never made myself get up and do something
about it. Sometimes it makes me feel like it is too late and my brain has matured that it cannot
mould itself to learn new things.

Whenever exams arrive I get super active and I am able to do the project I always wanted to do.
Or I watch the movies that I kept aside saying they took a lot my time from study hours, [_And still not
studying._] I try to minimize every distractions from my phone and everywhere and slowly within
few days I have everything enabled again. I try to study for an hour and fall into a deep rabbithole
of researching about this new interesting thing I found and forget about what I studied. [_And the
fact that I had to study as well._]

The worst part is that, being conscious about everything I am not able to change myself, and
I feel like it's too late every time. Every exams I think about these things and fail, and this
is the 6th semester I am at. Meaning I have been the same person for 2.5, almost 3 years with
no change. [_And by change I mean improvement, because I have degraded from everything I used
to do before as well and that wasn't really the change in me I was looking for._]

[_I have lost at everything I hoped would build me up for the past three years and I am scared
that I wont be able to change. I am scared that I won't ever be like the kid people saw in me
before. I am scared that I could never satisfy myself by being what I want to be and I keep hoping
and not doing anything about it._]

[_I keep wishing for things instead of working for it. I think I need to develop a habit of
working but I am very bad at it. Ironically, I who think that change is the best thing a human
can do, haven't changed to what I want to be. I don't want to repeat this the next time I am
near an exam._]

[_Also, weirdly enough I am having an anger issue which I never used to have. I feel like I am
crossing the limit. I don't want to see myself as pathetic anymore. I hope the ones who are reading
this would see the change in me. I'll work on it._]
