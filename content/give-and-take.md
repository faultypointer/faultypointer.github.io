I see many people expecting something in return when they do something
for someone. Returning a favor. Owing one. All these things are there as
a norm. Sometimes people expect something to be done out of love. [_or I have
to do it because I am someone to them. (like your relatives expecting a call
once in a while.)_] Humans have made giving and taking as inseparable parts of
a single process.

I mean, you should return something you
owe to someone. I am not against that. Taking and not giving back is practically
stealing. But, it doesn't always have to be a single process. Socially, I feel like
making things obvious that you did something and telling them that they have to repay
it somehow is awkward. [_I am going all over the place with this text._]

[_Well, look at open source developers, they get paid in respect (unknowingly) and hate; when it comes to hate (very
verbally). If they were paid back for what they did for you(Everyone), they would be too happy and also rich._]

I mean, there are some things that you just give and some things that you just take. [_Two/From
two different people._] Like advices, if you are given an advice, you don't owe an advice to them.
I don't have problems with exchange of things. But being entitled and expecting something
from someone is what I don't like.

And the other thing is people being generous and giving a lot for a little thing they did and
making people think like they owe them back now instead. [_I think you'll understand whom I am
referring with each they/them._]

Making promises for a favor is another. [_I will be able to do something for you in the future
if you give something now._] I can trust the people I am close to on this. But, strangers? [_Asking
for vote, huh?_]

[___Where am I going with this?___]

1. I don't want to feel like I owe someone something and someone owes me something.
2. I don't expect something in return for some help, don't keep mentioning it.
3. I can only help if I can and also if I want to. [_I normally do._]
4. I don't trust someone I don't trust and is unreliable. [_Takes twice to know._]
5. If it is something I deserve I will get it and if it is something you deserve you'll too.
6. Finally, I put myself in other person's place and think for once. [_You should too, it doesn't hurt._]
7. Really finally, I won't ask for something I think I am not qualified for or I don't know about just for my profit in it. [_That's something you earn, and you can't get it by  asking for it._]  
8. [_There may be more that I forgot to write while writing this._]  
9. [_In other words: etc._]

[_Best of Luck XD_]

I remembered this while writing this so here you go; this is how giving and receiving should feel like: [_:D_]

[_"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." "It is a love based on giving and receiving as well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving, we too can share and love and have and receive."_]
