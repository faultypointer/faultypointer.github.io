Teaching [_At least in a University_] is a profession that solely exists to support those who are researching
on their particular field. [_That's how I think of it._] The thing they teach is the thing they specialize in and are researching on to improve.
Teaching the subject they specialize in can reinforce their own understanding of the field, and having students to teach
means they can also share the possibility of new improvements to their students to test their [_student's_] understanding as well as potentially get different
perspectives on it.

I aimed to be a scientist, and to be one requires a lot of dedication and skill and also a lot of resources and funding to sustain it.
The structure that I have seen fund these scientists is that they teach as their profession in their field and for that the faculty
gets grants to fund their research as well as giving them a salary to sustain [_Life_].

But, the environment I described should be the norm, and it isn't where I live. I have to
tag it as an __Ideal Scenario__. Teachers who should have been the most respected people are almost hated and teaching is seen as a
last option profession.

I love the fact that teaching is a profession which is very social and almost "open source" with nothing to
hide, and can be modified to fit the needs without restrictions, by any capable teacher. But, its status in the society, even on campuses
is very bad. [_unrespectful, untrusted, hurtful_]

By not making the environment optimal as I have described above [_This system is practiced in almost all developed countries._], we get
teachers who have to repeatedly teach the same course surrounding preformatted
exam question patterns with very little room for letting the teachers explore how they want to teach and how they want to test the
students. Resulting in fewer chances for teacher-student discussion and interaction, and in a monotonous nature that causes teachers to lose interest in teaching itself.
[_Repeating the same thing for tens of years is very frustrating; I assume._] And it taking up all the time of the
day, and teachers having to end up tired at night and having to repeat the same cycle again another day just kills the potential of
teaching as a profession for Innovators and Pioneers.

A student in this system would not want to be a teacher at almost any cost. I have respect for all my teachers who are new and are energetic,
and who are old and have been so frustrated that they lost the fun in teaching and now do not care much. I hope someday this will not be the case,
because I assume that this education structure will only lead the capable teachers and researchers to leave the country searching for a better place
while the students are left to be taught by less capable people, only to end up losing interest and not caring about educating students at all.

[_Hopeful!_]
