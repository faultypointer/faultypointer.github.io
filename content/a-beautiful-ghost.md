You are a thing I constantly fear.  
That, one day, I will come across you.  
That, one day, I will have to face you.  
One day, what I don't want happens.  
Old habits that push me down.  
Fighting!  
With my consciousness that pulls me back.  

[_Bac...Back-off!_]

It's hard to fight with myself.  
My subconscious self.  
Who is better than being me than myself.  
Does things that I cannot do.  
Each step I take, you carry me.  
Don't let me fall.  
But the same friend is my foe.  
I fall harder with the false truth you carry.  

[_Bec...Because of me?_]

Yes! And No!  
I was the one who told you.  
That, it was correct.  
Because, I didn't know better.  
I didn't know, that, you wouldn't forget.   
I didn't know, I'd have to forget.  
Make you forget.  
Naivety killed the cat.  

[_W...W...Was I right?_]

Absolutely right!  
That's the correct question.  
No! You were not.  
You don't have to be.  
It's your nature to be fast.  
Not, "correct".

[_Wh...why bl...blame me then?_]

Because, I am failing to teach you.  
Tech you new things.  
I am failing to relearn.  
Relearn the true truth.  
What almost killed you.  
Almost killed me. Us.  
You are[_aa..I am_]too arrogant.  
I am too wea[_nnn...no I am not w...weak!_]  

[_N...N..Now what?_]

I want us both [_t...to learn t...together._]  
I want [_u...us both!_] to work together.  
Again!  
Like, we did.  
[_T...Together we will, ag...again._]  
Be me. More of me.  
More [_l..like me._]  
More like what [_aa_I_] want me [_t...to be._]
