# [_aaaactuallllly, EARN* what you want_]

The fact that you can get what you want just by asking for it
is calming and dangerous at the same time. And when you get what
you want just by asking for it, [_stratigecally or politely_] it
takes no time to get addicted to the comfort of asking.

A simple reminder that what you've got now is just something that
can be taken back by the person who gave it to you will keep you
on your toes grounded [_and frightened_]. And that is a good thing.
[_only if you ~remember~ realize it._]

Things can be owned by two ways, [_fortunately_] the other way is
by earning. And this is probably the most important thing to
remember because, what you've earned yourself can't be taken by
someone else. [_except for thieves :x_]

I have gotten a lot of things by just asking for it, [_sometimes
I forget that words are magic_] from _"things"_ [_hardware_] to
_"love"_ [_software?  (´ᴗ`‘)_]. The thing that I have realized from
my experiances is that [_like other things that I try to do myself
until it is not possible_] I have to get things by earning things
myself. [_I have said ""things"" so many times, it has stopped making sense XDXD_]

[_Quit asking! unless urgent?_] [_Asking is necessary, but only when it
is a necessity_]

[_Nights now! zZz_]
