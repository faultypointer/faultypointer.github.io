Stockholm syndrome is a proposed condition or theory that tries to explain why hostages
sometimes develop a psychological bond with their captors.[_Straight outa wikipedia. ; )_]

[_I personally learned about it from the show 'Money Heist'_]

The reason why I am talking about it is, like most of the time, I relate it to tech I
use. Nix, an operating system, a package manager and a [_FUNCTIONAL_] programming language.
It is a thing that I love as of right now in the linux/*nix world [_*nix because it works on
macs as well_] but, today when I was chatting on [niri's](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) [_it's a wayland compositor_] matrix
and YaLTeR who is the main developer of niri mentioned that our relation with nix is giving
the syndrome's vibes.

I thought about it and it really made sense. It is difficult to use for some time until
you get the hang of it. Then it gets super easy, installing packages and starting services
will be a breeze. Then when it comes to ricing and things that are done with hit and trial,
rebuilding the entire config each time [_which takes a lot of time_] gets frustrating. And
don't even ask how to get something running if a package you need isn't already packaged for nix. [_Which is very rare but
it's not as simple as following instructions from that package's repo._]

I knew about these issues before I even felt like nix was easy [_and by easy I mean, by practice
not inherently easy like Ubuntu_] and was something to keep using, it was kinda like a prison back then,
but now I feel like I cannot use any computer without it.

[_I guess it is Stockholm syndrome indeed. XD_]
