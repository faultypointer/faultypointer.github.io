[_If someone proves that something you believe is wrong is not only possible but
also accepted by those around you, to the point that it makes you question 
yourself and lose confidence in your own judgment, does that invalidate your
judgment?_]

_Are you fine with doing the gray things if someone else is doing it too?_

Anything will be validated to you if you ask in the right place. If you want 
killing animals to be a good thing, you ask a butcher how he is feeding his 
family. [_Or ask yourself if you aren't a vegetarian._]
If you want killing animals to be a bad thing, ask someone who has turned vegan.
[_Or just anyone without the context._] But, what do you think? What conclusion
do you reach from your own biases [_unbiased (externally)_] with your own
experiences.

_Does it automatically become a right thing to do if someone else does it?_

Other people can be wrong too. If your gut tells you it's bad, it has a reason 
to feel that way. But, that doesn't mean that you are correct.

Asking the questions that validates you no matter what, is the best way to be 
validated. You can just search "Why is it good to kill animals?" and you will 
get a million reasons why it is fine. And you will get a million reason for why 
it isn't fine if you ask why it is bad.

I am writing this because I wanted to charge my phone with my laptop's charger 
which felt like it isn't good, but I searched "Why is it fine to charge a phone 
with a laptop's charger?" to calm myself down to do the thing anyway.

This made me think how arrogant I can be in things I believe to be "the right 
thing" or "the right way". I mean, using Facebook is not good (because privacy)
 using windows is not good (because privacy) and I do stand by it because 
I have collected the experiences to say that it is bad. But saying the same
because some guy said it to me, or I read something about it, is like saying 
Pineapple on pizza is good (or bad) without even tasting it.

I am sure there is a name for this phenomenon. [_I'll ask ChatGPT about it._]
But I just can't believe the internet, and I can't believe the people around 
me. But is it because I don't want to be wrong? I spend my time trying not to 
be wrong, gathering the most optimal and the best of the best things to add 
to my personality. Is not wanting to be wrong taking away my precious time 
then being wrong a few times. Is it really worth it? 

Are you doing the same? Because ___anything you want___ to be true is true if 
you ask it in the right place.

[_If optimizing something takes too long, is it worth optimizing? Because what's
the point? \o/_]

[_BTW, I asked ChatGPT, it said: __confirmation bias__, __motivated reasoning__ 
and __echo chamber effect__._]
