My bed is one of the deepest place in the world. [_for me_] If I sit on it
I sink. If I lie on it, I sleep. If I sleep on it, I dream. [_If I dream on it
I forget what I had to do._]

I try to ignore it, I sit on the floor, I stand up and work, I sit on the table.
[_On the chair, I mean._] But it just pulls me. Like it is a black-hole that's
just for me.

I don't want to sleep at the daytime. But, if it just sits on it, I cannot help
myself to not lie on it and the cycle repeats. Changing the properties of the bed
doesn't work. I keep books, my sitting table, bags and everything on the bed, just
so I don't sleep on it on daytime. [_But I am lazy enough to just lie on the smallest
remaining portion of it._]

Actually, now that my "brain" thinks about it, it's not "Void Bed" it's "Void Brain".

[_Aaah... I have blamed my brain too many times, one of these days I'll achieve a praise for it._]
