I realize that I had a personality that revolved around being smart. That I 
was able to learn things fast and didn't need to make much effort to learn 
things or get "good" grades. I mean, it is a good thing to praise someone's 
ability to grasp things easily, but, when the same thing is validated by the
teachers, the family and everyone elseâ€”it doesn't take long to believe that
you are special, and you can do what nobody can do. Understand everything with
little to no efforts.

Basing your personality on being smart will only push you back. [_Few months to
whole years._]  That is, until you realize that it wasn't the correct thing to
base a personality on. When I didn't get the things on one go, I neglected it by
saying that I wasn't focused that time, promised to look at it again and never
looked back with the fear that I might not get it in one go. [_I am studying 
engineering, not that easy to understand on one go._]

I only took part in things I already knew and ignored everything else that I
didn't know. That is how I managed to fail most of the semesters of my 
engineering degree, I wouldn't read the books because failing by not reading 
was much easier than failing by trying. [_I could say to myself, "If I had
read I would have passed, it is just because I chose to not read."_] Yeah, I 
sounded that stupid. [_It was a threat to my own identity; I was supposed to be
smart, why was I struggling._]

_I would avoid difficulty instead of leaning into it and learning from it._

Thinking that I was better than other people, I would not respect the ones who
studied day and night to pass. I would say, I could understand things once I 
read it, they need to grind. This is how toxic one could get when the whole 
personality is based on one thing, "being intelligent/smart." [_I think 
"Inside Out: 2" touches on this concept very well._] 

I only realized that it needs hard work at the end of my bachelor year, while 
failing most previous ones. One day or another it needed to happen, It is almost
too late, but I should be thankful to myself for not letting it go further. I
still don't want to fail [_Who Does?_], but if I fail, I will know why instead 
of it being my arrogance of being "intelligent,  which I am not.

I have protected my identity of being a smart kid for so long, I am not a kid 
anymore and I don't care for being smart anymore. [_At least not that kind of 
smart._] While everyone was struggling and learning about things, I was locked 
inside my comfort zone. I am no longer wearing a mask of fake intelligence now,
I am struggling, and it's a good thing. I hope others like me realize this soon
enough. That is also a reason why I am writing this.

[___When you get praised for being smart, what people are actually praising is
effortless success, not hard work. This needs to change.___]
