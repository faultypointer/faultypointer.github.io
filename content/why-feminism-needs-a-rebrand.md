I mean this in the sincerest way possible. I have much respect for what Feminism represents
and I don't mean any disrespect toward the current as well as historical significance of
feminism. [_It is a very sensitive topic and I wouldn't have had to clarify that these are my views if it were
a bit easier to talk about._] And it has been a difficult topic to talk about just because I am a
man and this society has some bias [_and prejudice_] towards men talking about it.

> __From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism):__  
> Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish
> the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism holds the position
> that modern societies are patriarchal—they prioritize the male point of view—and that women are
> treated unjustly in these societies. Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes
> and improving educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women.

For someone who actually researches on the topic to understand what a word represents, [_Don't take that looking at
the wikipedia is research from this, it isn't, it in an ideal condition represents what the mass has agreeed on._]
the definition gives a pretty clear view for what feminism actually stands for. But, not everyone is like that, people
normally understand words by their composition. For example, when I found out that the beautiful dotted
red bug was called a ladybug, I thought it to be a female bug of that species, but ladybugs despite
their name represents both the female and the male bugs. [_Some people might have not known about this
fact, well, who cares about the gender of a bug, right? (except biologists ofcourse)._]

[_Hence, confusing ladybug with only the female bug isn't much of a problem._]

With the same logic, breaking feminism we get; fem-(in):  Relating to women or the female gender, and -ism: Denoting
a belief system or ideology. Though, this doesn't seem as problematic. At face value, feminism would be interpreted
as "women's system" [_Rule of women._] which it isn't. Though it was to uplift the women in the patriarchal society
and it mostly represented for the equal rights for women, it by no means is only related to women in today's context.

[_I won't argue against saying, "It's about women, why does everything have to about you for you to care."_]

Any rebrand is done to match the context of the present time, it represents evolution and positive growth. Sticking
to the roots is good but for such a sensitive topic [_(Which should not have been sensitive, because everyone should
have understood its significance by now.)_] it cannot [___shouldn't___] be interpreted wrongly. It might be justified
by the wording which goes something on the lines of `Equalism` or `Equityism` emphasizing equality and equity for all
people despite their diverseness.

As a male, I advocate about feminism in my own ways and efforts but in a male dominated society  and from my own
Experiences it would be much easier to convey the message and make people understand by representing the cause as
a neutral effort rather than something solely for women and by women, as the term 'feminism' might suggest."

[_Because, we humans are selfish by nature and are more likely to accept the cause if it is personal to us. On the
other hand, we reject it if it even remotely is against us. __(Cognitive Dissonance one might say.)___]

I myself am not against it, someone who is well-educated would not be against feminism for the same reasons as I am. With
enough context, anyone would say that it is foolish to be against feminism. A rational* person (not just man) would be foolish
if they didn't consider themselves a feminist, because it makes no sense to not accept, let alone reject being one. And
if someone doesn't like the concept of feminism it is because they don't understand it, it has been misrepresented to them
or they actually don't want anyone other than "their own kind" to have the privilege that they have.
[_Which is fundamentally unjust and inhumane, and we all know and understand what kind of people they are. __(Delusional)___]
