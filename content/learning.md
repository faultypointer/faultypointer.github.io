I love learning *new* things. [*I love reading in general and maybe I'll talk about that some other time*] It can be things from my syllabus, a new programming language[*I absolutely love learning new languages*] or a library or framework. I even tried [*and failed time and time again*] learning japanese. I'm currently reading a book called **How to Prove It** by *Daniel J. Velleman*.

And also a book called **Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra** by *Stephen Boyd* and *Lieven Vandenberghe*.

I'm taking a course on **Machine Learning Specialization** by *Andrew NG* on coursera.

And also learning The Go programming language.

All this while studying for six subjects this semester.

You're probably thinking "what a pretentious asshole" and I'm one but that is not the problem. You see the problem starts when another "interesting" thing comes up, or when the thing I am currently learning get kinda hard and I have to put way too much effort into it. Something it doesn't have to be anything. If I skip learning the thing I was learning for significant amount of time, there is a high chance I wouldn't want to continue it. Same goes for the projects I do.

So what do I plan to do to avoid this kind of stuff?

Absolutely Nothing.

Why would I? I **am** learning something.

I have huge respect for [*and am a little envious of*]  people who can just commit to a single thing and work on it for months and years but that stuff is not for me[*atleast not yet*].
If I can't commit to anything specific then so be it. And who knows, while I'm learning and trying out a bunch of stuff, I might find something I can just work on for years without getting any fatigue [*I really hope so*].

I **have** tried to reduce the time I spent on reddit, youtube and stuff. This way I can try even more stuff.

So what is the problem? Nothing I guess. Told you I was a pretentious asshole. Now, if I can just accept the fact that I don't have to force myself to commit to anything specific.

But I'm worried. What if I don't find anything until its too late. What if by the time I figure out the thing I want to do, it has advanced so far ahead that I can't catch up.

Too much deep stuff so can I just say, I'm listening to **No.6 Collaboration Project** and it is such a banger. Every single song on this album.

Back to brooding.
 What about job. I don't want to stuck at a job I don't wanna do for years because I can't find the thing I wanna do and I can't climb up in the current job because I just can't force myself into it.

I don't have anything to add but I don't wanna end this post on a pensive mood.

So, sorry anyone who got flash banged by my previous post.

[*Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers*]

The music went past **No.6 Collaboration Project** and now its playing other Ed Sheeran song. Most of his songs are bangers. Now it's playing **Bad Liar** by Imagine Dragons. Feels kinda nostalgic.

Also I'm alone today and it's night time. Perfect time to watch a horror movie[*Also perfect time to watch some other movies but today we get scared*].
