Firstly, I really don't know what it's like to be high. So, this is for what I
consider high. To be in a state where you feel nothing but extreme joy and you
forget everything else. [_So, now that we have my definition of high. Let's start
talking._]

First, you need a friend. [_One that understand the words coming out of your mouth.
(hehe, Rush Hour)_] You need something that you [_both/all_] are working on.
So, when you are researching on something and it fascinates you and your friends at
the same time, consider the process started.

When you feel joy about the topic you are trying to learn about. And when everything
that you are thinking ahead of time and are predicting, matches with what you are learning
about. You'll feel it. With joy, you'll start laughing and you laughing triggers your friend
laughing and your friend laughing triggers you laughing back and the process continues.
[_In engineering terms, A feedback loop._]

Engineers get high when the thing they are working on actually works. [_By works, I mean remotely
moves at all._] When what they know matches with what they are trying to do. When, you and your
friend both understand what's going on and how to go ahead. [_Sorta like, "Are you thinking what I
am thinking?", and it's almost the same every time._] We get high when brainstorming and it's actually
storming.

[_Trying out obscure things and making them work the way you want __(sometimes just on your head)__
(and seeing it work the way you wanted, when you think it shouldn't have), that's how to get high as engineers._]
