Org mode is one of the "modes" in Emacs. [_Could be the most lazy
Definition of org-mode till date._] So, what exactly is orgmode? 

Let's start with "Org". Org is a markup language like Markdown.
[_Could be the most lazy definition of org-mode till date._]
Is it a plain text system of writing documents? I can't exactly
describe it.

>  From __[orgmode.org](https://orgmode.org/)__  
>  Org is a highly flexible structured plain text file format,
>  composed of a few simple, yet versatile, structures â€” constructed

Well, it is a way to take notes, make to-dos and agendas, and organize your
thoughts, control your whole life.

And while or is a "typeset," org-mode is the controlling environment.
For that very typeset. Meaning, org-mode controls the org documents. 
One way to demonstrate is by making tables in org. [_BTW, you can do 
row/columnwise operations in org tables, like in a spreadsheet._]

I can't write anything because there are way too many things that org 
cand do. [_Ironically, I'm writing this blog in markdown._]

I have set org-roam up so that I can ditch Obsidian. [_The main 
problem is that I have stopped taking notes (somehow)._] [_And now
I have found the most beautiful of notebooks that I just want to 
make use of it._] [_That's what I feel about orgmode._]

[_I scoured the whole internet and didn't find a single GIF of
orgmode tables in action. -->_] [demo](https://youtu.be/cxoE2FhOIgI?si=_VmywiLBej4AdJML&t=261)
