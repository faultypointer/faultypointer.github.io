We live our life thinking that one day we will achieve something. But, before even starting
to write this article, or whatever I labelled it, I want to give you the TL;DR. _The only thing
that we achieve finally is Death and nothing else._ __Everything else? Everything else is what
we live.__

I like to walk, I mean I love to walk [_Out of my multiple first loves, it is probably my first, first love._],
Haha, giving importance to "first" isn't uncommon, but first most of the time is the worst. [_And it should be._]
And about walking, I never think how the destination will bring me joy, because the activity [_the experience_] of
just walking gives me the utmost joy. [_Better if I have a fried to talk walking with me._]
[_But alone feels great._] [_I can't decide on one, I mean walking is great (for me, you might not like it.)._]

So, what I mean is that I love walking, I mean we are happiest when doing things and not (as much) when we
achieve what we ought to. When we want something, we are the happiest when we are pursuing to get it, but it
loses a lot of the essence when we actually get it.

[_I just thought about this, but revenge, the thought of getting a revenge is always the strongest, but after
getting one, it just feels bad. So, kids don't take revenge (It's a bad thing to do)._]

I don't think there is more to write about this, the statement [_title_] gives it all.

[_I'll just make a part 2 of this if I come across something else that I can write about it._]

[_Goodnight now! ;-)_]
