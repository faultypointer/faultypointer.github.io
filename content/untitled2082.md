So, it's 2082 B.S. [_Not Bullshit, Bikram Sambat, like AD but for Nepali
Calendar._] I am living in the same age as you are, not the future. This is
just our calender system. And I wanted to write some clean slate style text 
here.

I have had a love hate relationship with love and hate. I have been through
loving and hating and finally being indifferent to the same person.
Though, if you graphed the time I spent loving to hating, the hating 
part would be negligible. [_But it is still hating, and it should count._]
Well, on that note, I treated "relations and the things we do in it" like a
barter system, like, I thought I deserved the same amount of love in return
for what I gave. [_Love is unexhaustive, or is it? That's a topic for some
other day._] I mean, I believe the same "belief" I had about love similar to
barter system, that, people deserve the same love they give to others was why
she "loved" me. [_Now, I don't know it was love or just a barter return._] It 
may be the same thing as falling in love with a character of a series.

___You love what you can predict.___

Humans are unpredictable creatures, no one knows what's going on other peoples
mind. So, to fall in love or to be able to predict that the person will not hurt
you or listen to you or whatever you think a person should do when they love 
you, is almost impossible. And the fact that there should be a two-way situation
for the thing I just described makes it even more impossible. So, is love 
impossible? [_You might say that it's not. And yes, people still fall in love._]
So, what is it? It's a compromise between two people to forgive the 
unpredictability in the hope that they will be predictable again. 

___You love until you can control.___

Then again, there is unconditional love. "Unconditional" being the condition for
love, which people don't realize. How do you forgive a person in the hopes that
they won't do the same thing that you think is wrong, again? It's when you can 
relate to a person, their experiences, their thoughts because you feel like
they'd understand what you feel and what you go through things. You fall in love
with the hope of being understood.

___You love the part of yourself in them.___

That being said. __You can't understand other people__ and when you think that 
you finally found someone whom you think you understand, you love them. When 
you understand what makes them happy or what hurts them. [_This again feels like
loving what you can predict because you can only predict what you understand._]

___You love what you understand.___

Maybe my version of love is selfish. Maybe it's not good to expect anything
from the people you love. But then again, if love was about comfort, why would
it take a lot of effort? Why would someone show effort to show love? Why would
it come with the responsibility toward them? Why would loving someone hurt? 

___You love what loves you back.___

Coming back to loving a part of yourself in them, you love the part of them you
wish you had in yourself. You love what you think would complete you. You
love...[_This is stopping to make sense the more I write, but I'll keep 
writing_]

___You love what you want as your own.___

Well I talked a lot about "you" now let me talk about "me".

___You love yourself.___

And the thing that I hate the most is the fear of losing what I love. And the
constant reminder of the fact that you'll always lose the one you love. 

___You hate what you can't have.___

___I love shiny new things___ but, shiny things doesn't remain new forever and 
not all new things remain shiny forever.

I really didn't want to conclude this but, ___You can only love what you can
respect___ and ___when you don't have to compromise___ on what you choose to
respect.

___You love when you choose to love.___

[_Happy New Year!_]
