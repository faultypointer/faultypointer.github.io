Since there is support for almost all characters in Unicode, all devices have been
able to render all kinds of characters. Characters ranging from Indic to Korean,
Kanji, Chinese... you name it. Today it is all smooth sailing, if it is written in
Unicode it works everywhere, hence, UNICODE.

But, if your language uses non-English characters and your government [_"Everyone" I mean._] used to use fonts that just
changed those English characters to your language and everyone [_Mostly old people._]
knew that font to be the main way to write in that language. You now are in trouble.

Those fonts had to be installed and setup so that if they are used they displayed properly.
Because the "characters" that you see are not understood universally be all computers. Only
the computer with your "font" installed will be able to show the characters you intended to write
otherwise, it will fall back to English.

One of the famous "legacy fonts" is _Preeti_. It is considered to be THE NEPALI FONT by
almost all [_old_] people. So, they use it to write documents and make presentations and
everything they need to do in Nepali. And now, when it reaches to someone else's computer [_(With no Preeti installed.)_],
you know what happens. [_All you see is English gibberish._] The [_old_] people will consider
that their pen-drive is corrupted or computer has virus and proceed to buy an antivirus.

I hate dealing with these kinds of fonts. And installing custom fonts on NixOS is almost a
pain. [_Unless you have already done it once._] And the fact that it won't work universally
means that even if you install _Preeti_ on your device, when you send it to someone else
it just won't work.

I would like you to boo the people if you see them using these kinds of fonts in this day and age.
Tell them to use a Unicode font that supports their language. __Noto__ being one example of that.

[_And lastly, I just hate dealing with Preeti. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa_]
