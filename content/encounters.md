I want to forget the things I want to forget. I want to move on and think
about things, I actually want to think about. Ideally, I would want to wipe
my memory of some things while still keeping the things that I learnt from
it. But, this is the defence mechanism of the brain, it is how it works and
how it tries to save us, warn us about making the same mistakes or decisions
again. Though the memories are unpleasant, it keeps us alive. And I really don't
want to make more mistakes.

Though I do consciously know the lessons I have learnt, [_without feeling the fear/pain._]
the memories just bombards me with a daisy chain of more memories and hence more and more emotions
about things. And those memories occur the most when you encounter the things
that caused you harm. Encounters when you're minding your own business, when
having fun when being calm, just shatter the current state of mind and I hate it
when it happens.

Naturally, to seem like an alpha, the strong one, the one who is stable and able
to face challenges, anti-forces, dangers, a human being learns from the mistakes and
faces it in new ways. I don't think I will complete give up on some concepts just
because I have faced challenges and obstacles when learning about it. But when these
memories of fear and harm come to you, to move on, I think you should just ignore them
to make them a minor forgettable thing but still keeping the things you have learned
from and made mistakes at in mind.

So, the next time I encounter things, I would want them to make no difference on my day
but only when trying out the thing that I had failed in, the precautions of experiences
should help. [_Ideally_]

But I think it's true about what they say.
[___No Pain; No Gain___]

[_Happy π day, everyone. Something that is as simple as a circle gave us π which is
infinite and never ending, yet nobody exactly knows it's value. You will
never be correct on what π is. And that's how I see life, you will never know enough about it,
it's just __learn, adapt, act, repeat__ till you achieve your infinity._]
