[_Yeah, you know it, I know it, we know it but, we always want a little more._]

Giving that extra effort, making that extra move, going that extra mile is fine [_(I know I am completely contradicting the title.)_] but only do it if you are doing it once. The efforts you
put should only scale upwards with time. [_Reality is often disappointing, and it normally goes
down._]

Well, why am I writing this? [_Such a nice way to increase the word count._] I ate a little too
much yesterday, and well if you give me the same thing I ate yesterday, I don't think I can look
at it, let alone eat it. Most of the time we don't know what the limit it, what our limit is.
[_Not saying that we let that limit be the final limit, but there will always be a limit_]

Doing the right thing at the right time, huh? We all wish that. [_let's not generalize, most of
us wish that.*_] And we just cannot, for the sake of science, know the right time or the right
thing. [_No, it's not a theory developed by Heisenberg._] [_I feel like I am talking to myself more
than writing this haha._]

When you try to do too much, you compensate it by doing too less the next time. [_How do I know?
I didn't use social media for 3 days and spent 13 hours on YouTube and shorts yesterday. (The data speaks.)_] Perfectly balancing the things is the best thing to do. [_Yeah, you heard that correct,
Thanos was right._] Slowly, I am being more dependent on AI to do things, and I don't like it.
Yeah, not using AI will surely push you backward, but the right way is to limit the usage.

Nothing is good when you don't limit it. You should eat in a limit, sleep in a limit, love in a
limit and yes also hate in a limit. Drink too much water, and it's bad, drink too less and it's bad.
[_Yeah, I know, I thought the same, I thought what could water do to harm you?_] Forget water,
if you somehow got too much oxygen you'll die, and you probably know what'll happen when you get
to little.

Sleep too little, that's bad, sleep too much, that's bad as well. Exercise too little, that's
bad, Exercise too much, that's bad as well. I can go on and on with each task on your routine and
it'll always be true. [_I guess knowing too much isn't bad._]

Yeah, everything in life remains good if you do it in a limit. Not too little not too much, you should be just right but not only on one thing, on everything.

[_I take that back, knowing too much isn't god either, I don't want to know if the girl I like,
but can't talk to, doesn't like me. (I would like the state of my mind when I didn't know about it.)_]

[_Also, the above line is totally fictional, I don't know if she doesn't._]

[_The above line isn't true, either. I don't have someone I like but can't talk to._]

[_Haha, it's "not true" all the way down until you reach the turtles._]

[___Only thing that is above and is true, is that too much or too less of anything is bad.___]
