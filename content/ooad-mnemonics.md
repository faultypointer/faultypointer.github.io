So, it's exam time and the first exam is on OOAD (Object Oriented Analysis and Design).
Reading a lot of lists and memorizing them requires mnemonics. Here are some of the fun
ones we (yeah not studying alone) [_though virtually_] created for OOAD topics:

> ### _Phases of Unified Process_  
>
> [___I eat crunchy tacos upstairs with my sons.___]
>
> - __I__ = Inception
> - __E__ at = Elaboration
> - __C__ runchy = Construction
> - __T__ acos = Transition
>
> And
>
> - __"sons"__ for all the words ending with "tion".
> - "__Up__ stairs" for __Unified Process__.
>
***

> ### _Different views of Object Oriented Analysis_  
>
> [___Functional US 2 Dollars.___]
>
> - __Functional__ = Functional
> - __U__ S = Use Case
> - U __S__ = Static
> - __D__ ollars = Dynamic
> - U __S__ __2__ Dollars = State Transition
> - US __2__ __D__ ollars = Deployment
> - __Dollars__ = Concurrency [_getit? con-currency_]

or

> [___Fuck-you too, Software Development, You Cunt!___]
>
> - __F__ uck-you = Functional
> too = 2 (there are 2 for S and 2 for D)
> - __S__ oftware = Static
> - __S__ oftware = State Transition
> - __D__ evelopment = Dynamic
> - __D__ evelopment = Deployment
> - __You__ (U) = Use Case
> - __Cunt__ = Concurrency
>
> [_This is a bit too vulgar and violent._] [_Which is exactly the type of thing you remember instantly._]
***

> ### _9 GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) Patterns_  
>
> [___God i.e. cunt, doesnt have sex, but sticks together, indirectly making pure babies, which are protected by various polymorphs.___]
>
> - __God__ = Creator
> - __i.e.__ = Information Expert
> - __cunt__ = Controller
> - __doesn't have sex__ = Low Coupling
> - __but, sticks together__ = High Cohesion
> - __indirectly__ = Indirection
> - __making pure__ = Pure Fabrication
> - __protected by various__ = Protected Variations
> - __polymorphs__ = Polymorihism
>
***

> ### _Types of Visibility in OOA_  
>
> [___App Log___]
>
> - __A__ pp = Attribute
> - A p __p__ = Parameter
> - __Lo__ g = Local
> - Lo __g__ = Global
