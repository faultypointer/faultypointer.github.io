Expert is someone who has made all the mistakes there is to make in a particular field.
I forgot who said this but it made so much sense. We wish to be experts , we wish to
know everything there is to know about something that interests us, but we humans are
lazy animals. We are evoltionalrily lazy. We try to conserve our energy and only use
it when we absolutely need it.

This mighthave been a survival strategy for out ansistors, they had to search day and
night for food travelling long distances,so they developed a brain to conserve energy
to use when it is necessary for survival, like running away from a preditor [_idk..
maybe swimming through the rivers_] or collecting food from trees or hunting.

In today's world we dont have to do any of those things. We are safe in our houses,
we get food from the market and eat, we use the means of transportation to travel.
[_We can even fly without losing any energy._] Just to live, we dont have to do much.
[_not, as much_] So, the only important thing for us is to use our brain to learn
things hoping to make or discover or invent new things from the informaton we have
gained [_probably, something to make our life more easier_].

But, the problem comes here; thinking and learning weren't the survivla strategies
we evloved with. But, in this age those are the most important skills to have, but
our brain doesn't give them much importance. [_I think that's what's wrong with me
too._] The ability to control our mind [_sounds preposterous, right? controlling
the very thing that controls us._] is the most important survival strategy and it
is very difficult because we aren't evolved with that.

I can't jsut say that only evolution affects lazyness, because, the other thing is
the environment we grow up in [_the modern world_]. The brain develops learning
things from this environment, the rights and wrongs, the goods and bads and the
grays and everything else. [_adaptaiton is the other main player in this, not just
evolution_] [I mean, it's like evolution but hapenning very fast._]
And I believe that we all should learn to control our own minds, to focus on something
[_anything_] and from a younger age [_we should be taught to do that_].

___To not give up and to keep making mistakes is the survival strategy.___

[_PS: It was Niels Bohr, the great Danish physicist, who said_]
> An expert is a person who has found out by his own painful experience all the mistakes that one can make in a very narrow field.
