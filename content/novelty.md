I love showing off the things that I have made. There is rarely anything novel
about the things that I make, it mostly comprises Frankensteined pieces of
different people's works of art. It is almost always something that is inspired 
from someone. But I adore the things that I make because I pieced them together
myself.

I also love seeing people use and love the things that I pieced together, It
makes me want to make more things. [_I do tend to force some of my dearest 
peers to use the things that I make, just so they can appreciate them 
afterwards._] I like spoon-feeding throughout the process of setting things up 
too. [_Even if it is not something made by me._]

And since the things I make contain the bits and pieces of other people's work
and also because I love open source I let people see how it is made and want 
people to fork off of my work to make their own version too.

But, I want uniqueness too. Ever since I have known about the word, I have
wanted to be unique. It's the reason I started using Linux, the reason I 
opened a GitLab account instead of GitHub. [_Though I use GitHub too now._]
I almost always used the things that the masses didn't use. I loved the concept
of making things myself that I joined engineering. And since the magic box is 
all that is needed to create new things myself, I joined computer engineering.
Unlike civil or architectural engineering or any other engineering where I 
would need more and more resources as I made things.

Coming back to novelty, I love adding at least one simple unique twist that is 
from my own brain. [_Though it might have been inspired from someone else 
subconsciously._] Though everything is a Frankenstein of other people's art. I 
give a heart to the Frankenstein body, myself.

[_Someday, I wish I will create something entirely with all my ideas._]
[_That day, you'll know about it because I will probably be pushing it down
your throat. (With Love, dear reader.)_]

[_Please don't mind it, okay? :D_]
