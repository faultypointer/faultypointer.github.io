Modern logos and design rely heavily on simplification of everything.
This site being one of the examples. I do like a minimalistic design.
But when it comes to uniqueness and personality of something, things
turn a different way. The more minimal we go the more general and bland
it gets. It'll lack the [_personality_] of it to show it's difference
from others. While a maximalist approach would include tiniest of details
to make it more unique and personal than ever, a minimal design would take
some very clever tricks to achieve uniqueness.

This site is directly inspired by [manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/)'s
site but I wanted to add my own touch to it as he also has given to it.
I wouldn't say his site lacks personality because I loved the design and
the minimalistic approach of his site that I wanted one for myself too.
But, to make my site more personal and unique in itself I added a handwriting
style text for my inner voice [_inner voice... [_inner voice..._]_] for the
things I think while writing.

Similarly, I designed my main logo which is an "s" but made completely of
straight lines. [_Which I am very proud of and I talk about it whenever I
get the chance to._]

But, thinking about personality, I sometimes wish that apples were rainbow
colored and the window glasses were tinted with colors.

[_A colorful place for colorful minds._]

But, [_("but" strikes back)_]  I love a good minimalist approach of things.
I like the new mozilla logo. I like the fact how the new Pepsi's logo look
and yes I do love GNOME's foot. [_(Wouldn't call it a fetish though. XD)_]

[_Because they have their quirks and their own personalities._]
