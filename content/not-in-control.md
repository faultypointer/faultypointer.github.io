There are too many things we cannot control. [_I wish I could go back in time and fix things._]
Controlling yourself is hard enough, I wonder how difficult would be controlling "time".
I didn't decide to write this thinking I couldn't control time. [_Actually I had put this
topic on "things to write about" yesterday, and today I don't remember what inspired me to put
that there. Regardless, I am writing about it._]

[_Apparently I cannot control what I want to remember._]

Just the fact that I learned something yesterday which I don't remember today haunts me.
I guess I will remember what I learned when the situation asks for it. Anyway, I would
love for things to be on my control. [_I guess that's what "power" is._] [_I think every
one likes to have things in their control._] But, instead of controlling others or things,
the best thing one can do is fully control themselves. [_Which nobody can._] [_I can't even
control a fraction of myself._]

Controlling yourself boils down to laziness and habits. And I have a very bad habit of being
lazy and letting things out of control. The more I try to control myself over doing things
(my bad habits) [_No, I don't smoke. But, it's worse than that._] it pulls me too hard that I
go back to it. [_I cheat myself._] It's wishing to reach a destination and making no efforts
towards it.

Other things I want to control is what I say to people. [_I want to control my privacy._] Though
I know that everything I speak can be used against me. I share things, I vent things out of control.
Almost to people who wouldn't care to listen or worse who don't care about me. [_Best thing that can
happen when venting is that they remember nothing about it, but you feel good telling it._]
Writing about things help me have second and third thoughts before I actually say something.
For someone who knows so much about privacy on the internet and uses signal, I am a fraud for
being what I am in real life. [_Like, I regret saying some things to some people, which thankfully
haven't been used against me._] [_I am controlling it fairly well these days._]

I say I won't eat junk today, and I end up eating fast food. I say I will wake up early and end up skipping
the alarm and waking up at 9. I say I'll miss out on things and end up using "the social media" for
far too long. Controlling myself to do things I want to do has been difficult. I don't expect exerting
power and control over others. [_One thing I can somewhat control is my computer. And I am studying to
be able to do it more._]

___I am not in my own control.___ [_But, I realize, slowly is the way to go._]

[_Fully controlling myself and my computer, __that's the dream.___]
