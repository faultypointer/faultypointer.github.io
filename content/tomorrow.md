Tomorrow, I will write the thing I wanted to write about.  
Tomorrow, I will start doing the thing that I wanted to do.  
Tomorrow, I will study what I need to study.  
Tomorrow, I will get up early and do everything right.  
Tomorrow, I will fill up the daily step tracker.  
Tomorrow, I will control my screen time.  
Tomorrow, I will work on my routine.  
Tomorrow, I will do it no matter what.  
Tomorrow, I will complete whatever is due.  
Tomorrow, I will revamp my room and make it efficient.  
Tomorrow, I will think about what to do next.  
Tomorrow, I will be a better me, that I wanted to be.  
Tomorrow, I will complete this poem.  
Today, I will wait for Tomorrow and chill.
