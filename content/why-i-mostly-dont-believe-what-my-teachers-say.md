Teachers are one of the most respected people in my opinion. They teach us about
the things we don't know, the things we need to know, and the things that we want
to know. They are technically the most trustworthy people. But, I am very
unsatisfied with how some of the teachers of my campus behave and work. My biggest
gripe with my teachers is that they aren't passionate about their work. Some teachers
just do not care, and some act like ChatGPT who give answers to every possible question
at an instant even if they aren't related to the field and even worse is that they
are highly confident about it.

Complaining about teachers feels very wrong, it makes me feel like a "bad" student.
I wish I could trust each word [_Even if not a 100 but 95%_] from their mouth when
teaching, but that isn't possible. [_At least I think that isn't possible._] I should
    not have to cross-check if my teacher said something wrong, and I noted it down, It
should be enough to know the basics about the topic with confidence when they teach it.
This isn't much of a big deal when they are teaching their own subjects, which they have
been teaching since ages, but the fact that I know what is correct, and I am being
taught what isn't [_If only it was that one time._] makes me super worried about the
validity of everything else I have learned from them. [_This made me sound more arrogant
than it should be, I don't mean to be arrogant._]

The other thing is professionalism, some of my teachers aren't professional [_In terms
of behaviour._] at all. Some think they are superior to other teachers and by that power
they can do almost anything. Sometimes students are ignored/crushed under the ego of some
teacher. [_Which makes me see them in a very negative way, and I don't want to feel that way._]
Some of the blames for un-enthusiasm for teaching can be blamed on the system as well, because
the end result is determined solely by tests that don't really relate to teacher's teaching
methods and how they want to test their students.

Teachers and students are interconnected, one cannot exist without the other. So, not everything
is to be blamed to the teachers. I feel the lack of respect from the students to their teachers.
Arriving in time for the class is one of them. And with my observation, if more students respect
a teacher, more students, arrive on time for their lectures. But when the system is such that teachers
have very little effect on the results of the students they teach, the respect for them immediately
shallows down.

If a teacher can take tests in their own way and evaluate students for what they have analysed
and came to the conclusion of how they have to test the students and the results depended on how the
students did in the entire semester and not just a 3 hour + 1 hour exam, both the teachers and students
will develop a relation that is respectful as well as collaborative and enthusiastic. This way both
the teacher and students could sustain each other, and even work together to solve new problems they
come across.

On the other hand, the tests done at the end of the semesters just takes away the power of the teacher
to know the understanding of their own students and further degrades the relation of the teacher and
their students. Because, it encourages knowing what to write instead of understanding the subject.
When, sitting through the lectures and solving problems for the assignments though in theory should help a student
to solve real life problems if they come across it. Instead of that, I feel like I am learning to
write things in the exams and forget about them after exam.

For all this there also arrives a question that, if I have to learn about the things I have come to
learn, from my own research at home, or [_orrrr_] just practice the past papers and optimize my writing
according to what it wants, why come to college at all? Why not go there just for the exams? But, yeah
there is a catch there too, I have to attend college just for the sake of attendance because lower
attendance means no entry to the exams.

[_I just hate sitting through a lecture I have to fact-check afterwards, which doesn't give much info
for how to solve the questions for exams because what the lecturer taught doesn't align on how we are
tested afterwards, and feeling like I could have learnt a little more or practice for exams a little more
if only I knew what to learn next for the course (which I can find out myself a well)._]

_The lectures are important enough to understand the subject, but not enough to pass the exams. And
Prioritizing exams just cuts off from the learning, understanding and problem-solving aspect of college time._

[_Also a reason why there aren't much published research papers from my uni._]
