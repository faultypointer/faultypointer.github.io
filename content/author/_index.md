title = "Hi, I am flux."

There is nothing to know about me. I don't matter. What matters is what I write,
and I write to know how I am evolving over time. This blog may be totally on
point or far fetched from reality [_Yeah, mostly far fetched..._] but that is a mental state I have and I love it.

Before believing anything I write, first think about it yourself.

[_This is the consience of flux speaking! Ahm!! mic test! mic text!_]  
[_Can you hear me loud and clear?_] [_I try to clarify what flux writes._]

_And I am not an AI, and I don't use AI to write these posts, so you can trust me if you trust a real human.
But, I do use AI sometimes to "get validated on something" or to do repititive tasks._

[_Don't worry, I proofread everything and don't let AI add any words to my text._]
