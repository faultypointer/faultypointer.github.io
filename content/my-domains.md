It has been some years, maybe 2 ~ 2.5 since I bought my first domain.
And when I bought it, I was super excited about what I could do with this single
one, I could set up mail forwarding, make myself a website, a blog and what not.
It was like owning a place on the internet. [_Not the walled garden but the open web._]

My first domain was [scientiac.space](https://scientiac.space), I chose a space
domain not because .com wasn't available, but I wanted it to be unique. [_Like, it
was my space in the internet._] I set up almost everything using that domain, everything
I could, I did. I use it as a blog on [scientiac.space](https://scientiac.space) and
as public notes [_notepad?_] at [map.scientiac.space](https://map.scientiac.space) and many
other things. While developing the blog, I checked the preview card by sending the link to
messenger, and I did it so many times that this site got flagged as spam at Facebook.

I then decided to buy another domain called, [carboxi.de](https://carboxi.de) which
was a cheap domain because of .de, and I wanted it to sound cool. [_Like, lobste.rs_]
I used carboxide as the main way to share my blog on Facebook. That was all it was used
for, for some time. But, now it is another blog like place but also like a computer club where I give
subdomains to my friends to use. And it has been my safe space.

Then out of stress I bought [3o14.com](https://3o14.com) in the middle of my ongoing
exams. I am a nerd and I wanted something that represented me, and it was 'pi' the letter
that had multiple meanings, and not just mathematical. I could not just but pi.com or 14.com
to make it 3.14.com because getting 2 lettered domains is super expensive and difficult. I
thought of 3point14, but that was too long. I came up with 3o14 that looks like 3.14 and is
pronounced 3o14 but represents 3point14.

I love these places I have on the internet, they are a part of my personality and I don't think
that I can ever lose them.
