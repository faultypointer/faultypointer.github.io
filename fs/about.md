Hi, I'm **sudesh subedi**.

I'm currently a computer engineering student(about to graduate soon).
Having said that, I still have no idea where my interest lies. I've narrowed it down
to a few areas like
- Algorithm Design
- Programming Language Theory and Compiler Design
- Operating Systems

They are very big fields each having a large numbers of areas within themselves to choose from.
Hopefully I can narrow my interest down to just one before graduating.
