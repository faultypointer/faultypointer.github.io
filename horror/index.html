    <h1 class="p-name"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faulty.carboxi.de">I Love Horror Movies</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content p-content">
            
            <p>I have loved paranormal stuff ever since I was a kid. I don't know how it started. Maybe it was because of the tales of ghosts, rituals, strange monsters and everything else you can imagine I overheard my mom and aunts talk about. Or maybe it was ignited by the stories of gods and asur my grandfather would tell us.</p>
<p>I loved hearing about some kid being possesed by a god, a dead family member haunting the house, a strange creature that comes out at night near the pond, the haunted mill that was closed because an employee died while operating the machine. It is usually more thrilling when you visit a relative's and then you hear about the paranormal stuff that happened at the neighbors just the day before.</p>
<p>As much as I love to listen <em class="inner-voice"><em>or talk or read or watch or anything</em></em> about paranormal stuff be it ghosts, demonic creatures, aliens, strange events, I don't really believe in any of it. <em class="inner-voice"><em>well I don't not believe in aliens, but thats a whole different story</em></em>
That doesn't mean I don't get scared of horror movies <em class="inner-voice"><em>if that were the case, this post wouldn't even be a thing</em></em>, or paranormal stories. I do get scared while watching horror movies, and not just because of the jumpscares, and I do get scared while walking somewhere alone in the night <em class="inner-voice"><em>that may be because of totally different reason but the paranormal factor still adds to that</em></em>, and I do get scared when its all dark and I feel like something or someone might be next to me.</p>
<p>My point is that even if I don't believe any of the paranormal stuff to be real, I am absolutely scared by them.<em class="inner-voice"><em>which I think is a very good thing</em></em>
So, How can that be? How can I be scared of something I definitely believe to be not real? Well I don't know. Maybe I'm pretending to not believe in those things.<em class="inner-voice"><em>I'm not but still lets entertain the idea</em></em> Maybe subconsciously believing them to be fake helps me cope with it.<em class="inner-voice"><em>again cope with fucking what but lets pretend</em></em> Mayb-. Okay, you know what. I'm running out of ridiculous reasons for me to be faking about not believing in all this stuff. So here goes. <strong>I absolutely one hundred precent do not believe ghosts or any other paranormal stuff(except maybe the aliens related ones) exists in any form what so ever.</strong><em class="inner-voice"><em>While we are at it, I also don't believe in afterlife. I think there is absolutely nothing after death. So live your life to the fullest</em></em>
And you can quote me on that.</p>
<p>After all that foreplay, lets finally talk about the title. <code>I Love Horror Movies</code>.
It all started with those shitty Indian horror movies. <em>Veerana, Khooni Panja</em> and all others that I forgot the names of. They are all shitty movies by today's standard but they made me fall in love with the horror genre.</p>
<h2 id="early-days">Early Days</h2>
<p><em class="inner-voice"><em>surprise!! Headings. Nice right?</em></em>
My introduction to Hollywood was probably from the horror movies too. These are the movies I watched in my school days (probably class 6, 7) which is why I can't name a single one of the top off my head except Conjuring. I do remember what I didn't watch: Insidious, Wrong Turn, Paranormal activities.<em class="inner-voice"><em>I still haven't watched them by the way. Never will. I think the time has passed on these ones.</em></em> I used to love zombie movies like Train to Busan and <em class="inner-voice"><em>yet again</em></em> all others that I can't remember. As you can see, I don't really remember much from this time.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-the-internet">Welcome to the internet</h2>
<p>Finally wifi in the house<em class="inner-voice"><em>well technically wifi in the rented room but still wifi!!</em></em>. It was around the time I discovered reddit so that meant I had a lot more and good movie recommendations. It was also around the time I started to watch TV series which is probably why I watched horror movies which were a part of a cinematic universe. Or maybe It was because of MCU.
I don't really remember much about Halloween and don't really care. I remember Michael Myers and his mask. I remember some other stuff which I not entirely sure is from Halloween movies like Monica from friends begin in one of the newer ones. I checked and it was not Halloween. It was Scream.</p>
<p>I remember the first Freddie Kruger movie quite well. Although I had to check what the name was. It was more memorable than the Halloween ones. I still know the overall summary. Guy gets burned because of misunderstanding? <em class="inner-voice"><em>maybe he was actually a pedo or murderer. can't remember</em></em>. Haunts the chidrens of the people who were responsible? for his death. I don't think I watched any of the sequels tho.</p>
<p>I watched almost all of the saw movies, I think. It got progressively worse.
I am like 99 percent sure I watched atleast some of the Friday the 13th movies but I can't remember anything. Literally nothing comes to my mind.<em class="inner-voice"><em>And It doesn't even make sense. I love friday the 13th. The date. Not only is it the 'horror' date but it is also the day I was almost born. If only I was 10 minutes early. Saturday the 14th. 00:10. Mark the date. And the time.</em></em>
Scream was a good twist on the slasher genre. For the first one. Then it got repeatative. It was still fun.
I never got into the Cunjuring franchise. I watched the first conjuring and the annabell. Maybe I watched the second conjuring. Never got into the nun movies.
Finally the two of my favourite horror movie franchise: Child's Play and Final Destination.
Like saw, the chucky movies did get shittier but I still enjoyed them very much. Same with Final Destination. I was genuinely excited when I heard about the chucky series. I'm also excited <em class="inner-voice"><em>not much tho</em></em> about the new Final Destination movie thats about to come.</p>
<p>There are a lot of horror movies and tv shows that I watched and if I went on to explain each of them like this, it will be a very long post. <em class="inner-voice"><em>which it already is.</em></em>
So I'm just gonna list "few" of the movies and tv shows that come to my mind. The hunting of the hill house. As above so below. The grudge (not the sitty american remake). Skinamarink. Midsommer. Get out. Us. Late Night with the devil. Descent. Rec. Goodnight mommy (not the shitty american remake). Sinister.</p>
<h2 id="no-gore">No Gore</h2>
<p>Let's talk about what I like in a horror movie or rather what I don't like and I don't like gore. I can handle severed limbs, severed heads, severed <insert any body part> just like the next guy. Exploding heads, eye pops out, flaying, I'm good with all of that. But if the whole horror aspect is in the shock value of gore then count me out. Same with jumpscares. If done right and in moderation, jumpscares are the best part of the movie for me.</p>
<p>I watch horror movie because I like to be scared. So anything that makes me scared, I like. Mostly it is the atmosphere. I want the movie to be so dreadful that I have to fight the urge to pee in the middle on night, that I don't wanna get out of bed.</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-condition">The Perfect Condition</h2>
<p>You can't be scared of a horror movie without the perfect (or atleast somewhat favorable) setting. One of the most crutial part of that setting is being alone. If I can see other people, all that sense of dread is gone. Sometimes being alone in the room is also not enough. I've lived in a rented rooms for nearly five years on two different cities and I've watched many horror movies in said rooms. But they just don't hit the same when watching horror movies alone in my home. It really does help that my home is located in a town. And when you are home alone then you are really home alone. It just feels different. I don't know how to explain it.
I don't think I need to say why night time is the best <em class="inner-voice"><em>and only</em></em> time to watch horror movie.
Now weather. Any weather is fine as long as the previous conditions meet but if its raining and specially with lightning and thunder<em class="inner-voice"><em>sidenote: I've the similar feeling about lightning and thunder as I have of paranormal stuff. I am scared of it but I also thing it's the absolute best weather for falling asleep.</em></em>, It. Is. Simply. The. Best.</p>
<p>I think I've rambled on for long enough. I don't have anything to add. Bye.</p>
