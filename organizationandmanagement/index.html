    <h1 class="p-name"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faulty.carboxi.de">Organization and Management</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content p-content">
            
            <p>I have used <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a>, <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> or I should say I have
tried to use them to keep notes, maintain todos and more. I have even tried just markdown with neovim and none of them have worked for
me. This is probably a me problem cause I've seen people using these tools to keep notes and all the other things so good that I feel envious.</p>
<p><em>Why do I need to keep things so organized? If these tools are not working, maybe I'm fine with keeping things disorganized.</em></p>
<p>But I like the idea of organizing such notes. Having pages and pages of information that you've filled over a significant amount of
time, whether by summarizing a textbook or writing out your thoughts, appear as an interconnected web that somewhat reflects your
personality is a dream of mine.</p>
<p>Before I say What I think is the problem, Lets walk through an example scenerio of what happens when I use such app.</p>
<p>Let's say I've heard about a new note taking app with pretty unique feature. I would most likely want to try it out. After looking at the features, I
think maybe this is the one. <em>Deep down I know I'm going to abandon this as well but no harm in trying</em>. For first few days, I will try the app and come
up with some workflow based on that app. I will maybe write journals or things I need to complete each day, notes, all sorts of writings, links to some
resources, ideas etc. After getting used to it, I feel productive with it. It feels like nothing can stop me and maybe this one will actually work. <em>It won't</em>
The routine will work flawlessly for few weeks then it will slowly deteriorate. I will use the app/workflow less and less each day until I completely
abondon it.</p>
<p>Even though I like to be organized, I don't think I'm an organized person. The most significant problem with all of this is organizing notes and todos. I like to
write for a lot of different things. Things like notes for subjects on my curriculum, notes for the things I'm learning, blogs, writing about projects, writing about
an online article I found interesting and maybe more. So, it just doesn't make sense to keep them all under the same directory. It also doesn't make sense to have a
single file type like markdown to write all those different types of notes. I want to have the power of org-mode when writing a blog about algorithmic problem and simple
markdown for something else and maybe just comments on the source file for notes on solving a problem from Advent of Code. In that regard, Emacs and Org-mode came very close
to solving the organization problem and I do believe that it's my lack of knowledge about emacs and org-mode to develop a workflow similar to the solution I'm going to present
soon.</p>
<p>Another problem I have is that I love terminal. So anything that requires me to open a different app already feels less motivating. <em>even though I have no problem wasting hours watching videos on youtube in a browser</em>
This is also the reason I use helix for editing dotfiles or for simple one off codes even though I use emacs as my editor. <em>I know I can use emacs in terminal.</em> Although I said having a web of interconneted notes was like
a dream of mine, I once moved from obsidian (which literally had that built in) to neovim just because it was in terminal.</p>
<p>I don't know what can solve my problem at the moment. All I can think of is that either I learn how to use emacs org-mode (and maybe roam) properly or make a cli myself. I don't have time for either of them so
just gonna wait for a new app or some free time to come.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
