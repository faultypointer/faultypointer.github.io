It was because I really like the concept of a completely custom yet static social media where it's not instant but it's regular communication. But, the drawback of any kind of unique and DIY technology is not having people that actually use it.</p><p>Ironically, after the setup, I only have received Webmentions from myself during testing (<em>I am not counting the mastodon likes that propagated through <a href=\"https://fed.brid.gy/web/scientiac.space\">Bridgy Fed</a>)</em>. I am still sceptical about Bridgy Fed because It isn't what I wanted Webmentions to be, I didn't want any connections to a social media but I wanted to test the workings so I connected it.</p><h2>How I Do It</h2><p>My blog is a static site and being static comes with the cost of not being able to continuously listen to incoming messages. So, Webmentions don't really work on a static site. At least that's what I thought at first, then I found out about <a href=\"https://webmention.io/\">webmention.io</a>.</p><p>It's sort of like a retrofitted static site to support Webmentions.</p><h3>Components</h3><ul><li>A Static Site Generator <a href=\"https://www.getzola.org/\">www.getzola.org</a></li><li>Indieweb Compatibility <a href=\"https://indiewebify.me/\">indiewebify.me</a></li><li>Send webmentions <a href=\"https://webmention.app/\">webmention.app</a></li><li>Receive Webmentions <a href=\"https://webmention.io/\">webmention.io</a></li><li>Render Webmentions <a href=\"https://keats.github.io/tera/\">keats.github.io/tera</a></li><li>Runner <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions\">GitHub actions</a></li></ul><h4>A Static Site Generator</h4><p>I am using <code>zola</code> as my static site generator and I love it. The comfort of just writing in <code>markdown</code> and letting <code>zola</code> do the heavy lifting to generate feeds is awesome. Generating an Atom/RSS feed is a must. This is needed by webmention.app to send webmentions by reading all your posts.</p><h4>Indieweb Compatibility</h4><p>To make an Indieweb compatible static site you need to pass these tests from <a href=\"https://indiewebify.me/\">indiewebify.me</a>.</p><ol><li>Web Sign In - This helps you sign in to indieweb services with your domain. <em>You must have your own registered domain name.</em></li><li><code>h-card</code> and <code>h-entry</code> classes on homepage as well as on the \"post\" page.</li><li>Ability to send Webmentions.</li></ol><h4>Sending Webmentions</h4><p>I use my generated Atom feed and webmention.app <a href=\"https://webmention.app/docs#using-the-command-line\">CLI</a> to send Webmentions. It is as simple as running:</p><pre style=\"background-color:#282828;\"><code><span style=\"color:#fdf4c1;\">npx webmention https://scientiac.space/atom.xml --limit</span><span style=\"color:#fe8019;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#fdf4c1;\">0 --send\n</span></code></pre><h4>Receiving Webmentions</h4><p>To receive Webmentions you need a perpetual listening server and the service is provided by <a href=\"https://webmention.io/\">webmention.io</a>.</p><ol><li>Sign into webmention.io with your domain. It will use <a href=\"https://indielogin.com/\">indielogin.com</a>. This requires you to have at least an email address on your h-card.</li><li>Go to <code>sites</code> and in the table click on <code>Get Setup Code</code> which will give you a tag to put on your HTML template header.</li><li>Test that you actually can receive Webmentions by mentioning yourself in a site and running the above command. It should show up in the dashboard of <code>webmention.io</code>.</li></ol><h4>Render Webmentions</h4><p>You can now fetch the json feed of the Webmentions you have received in webmention.io using the following command and replacing the <code>${WEBMENTION_TOKEN}</code> with your own token.</p><pre style=\"background-color:#282828;\"><code><span style=\"color:#fdf4c1;\">curl -s </span><span style=\"color:#b8bb26;\">\"https://webmention.io/api/mentions.json?token=${</span><span style=\"color:#fdf4c1;\">WEBMENTION_TOKEN</span><span style=\"color:#b8bb26;\">}\"</span><span style=\"color:#fdf4c1;\"> -o webmentions.json\n</span></code></pre><p>This json file can be used to render the Webmentions on your website using your static site generator's feature to read json files.</p><p>I made and activity page in zola where all the webmention activities are listed.</p>Zola Template HTML<p>This is located at <code>templates/activity.html</code> and used at

In general I like to utilize three activities to send Webmentions. [<em>It is preferred to only use one activity for one mention.</em>]</p><h3>Mention</h3><p>One can mention a site using webmention by simply putting the link to the page being mentioned. The site will get the webmention if it supports it.</p><pre style=\"background-color:#282828;\"><code><span>[Void Bed](https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/) by flux.\n</span><span>or\n</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\"></span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;font-weight:700;\">a </span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;\">href=</span><span style=\"color:#b8bb26;\">\"https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/\"</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&gt;</span><span>Void Bed</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&amp;LT/</span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;font-weight:700;\">a</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&gt;</span><span> by flux\n</span></code></pre><h3>Like</h3><p>One can like a post using webmention by formatting the link as follows:</p><pre style=\"background-color:#282828;\"><code><span>I like how flux talks about his bed in </span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\"></span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;font-weight:700;\">a </span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;\">class=</span><span style=\"color:#b8bb26;\">\"u-like-of\" </span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;\">href=</span><span style=\"color:#b8bb26;\">\"https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/\"</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&gt;</span><span>Void Bed</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&amp;LT/</span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;font-weight:700;\">a</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&gt;\n</span></code></pre><p>I like how flux talks about his bed in <a class=\"u-like-of\" href=\"https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/\">Void Bed</a></p><h3>Reply</h3><p>One can reply to a post by formatting the link and the text as follows:</p><pre style=\"background-color:#282828;\"><code><span style=\"color:#83a598;\"></span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;font-weight:700;\">a </span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;\">class=</span><span style=\"color:#b8bb26;\">\"u-in-reply-to\" </span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;\">href=</span><span style=\"color:#b8bb26;\">\"https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/\"</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&gt;</span><span>Void Bed</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&amp;LT/</span><span style=\"color:#8ec07c;font-weight:700;\">a</span><span style=\"color:#83a598;\">&gt;\n</span><span>\n</span><span>I feel the same about my bed.

Because, I want the articles to have a \"blog interaction\" from other peoples blog but not from the social media. But, I do use bridgy on my short posts sometimes. <a href=\"https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2024-11-05/\">Webmentions</a> and <a href=\"https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2025-02-04/\">Linux is/not Difficult</a> are some posts I have used bridgy with and they also work as example posts to see how different webmention activities look like in my website.</p><h2>Lastly</h2><p>I had forgotten about webmentions and interactions on my site, but I recently read a post from Joel titled <a href=\"https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/webmentions-but-manual/\">Webmentions but manual (for Jekyll)</a> and people giving names to the interactions really caught my attention. I haven't given it a name because mine are just Webmentions but I feel like Webmentions are still a good option to have <em>(with much less spam)</em> for interaction if it isn't connected to an actual social media. Some other posts I read were: [<em>At least for the sake of just pinging them.</em>]</p><p><a href=\"https://notes.jeddacp.com/implementing-community-echoes/\">Implementing Community Echoes</a><br /><a href=\"https://forkingmad.blog/blog-interactions/\">Blog interactions</a><br /><a href=\"https://kevquirk.com/blog/what-others-said\">What Others Said...</a></p><p>I hope webmention on blogging sites takes off. Or maybe it has already taken off. I want the future where everyone can express themselves with their own taste and creativity not having to compromise personality for protocols.</p>","published":"2025-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","published_ts":1756598400},"activity":{"type":"like"},"target":"https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/"},{"source":"https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2025-08-28/","verified":true,"verified_date":"2025-10-05T15:17:46+00:00","id":1935421,"private":false,"data":{"author":{"name":"scientiac","url":"https://scientiac.space","photo":"https://scientiac.space/res/thumbnail.png"},"url":"https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2025-08-28/","name":"Rusting","content":"<p>Trying to replace as many apps I use with the apps written in rust to see how much is possible.</p><p><a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://flux.carboxi.de/continuous-oxidation/\">Continuous: Oxidation</a> by flux was very helpful.</p>","published":"2025-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","published_ts":1756339200},"activity":{"type":"reply"},"target":"https://flux.carboxi.de/continuous-oxidation/"},{"source":"https://flux.carboxi.de","verified":true,"verified_date":"2025-08-31T08:46:27+00:00","id":1935345,"private":false,"data":{"author":{"name":"flux","url":"https://flux.carboxi.de","photo":"https://avatars.webmention.io/flux.carboxi.de/6ba7ff080dbbed683db92df73660537ba313a6a4dedefd6bd3476e8bd5c4a2c4.png"},"url":"https://flux.carboxi.de/creation-consumption-trying-testing/","name":"Changing, Trying, Testing","content":"<p>For some years now <em><em>meaning: many years now</em></em> I have been into Linux and with being in the Linux \"ecosystem\" I have grown a taste in what kinds of software I use and like to use.</p>\n<p>It's the software that is Free and Open Source, that respects your privacy. <em><em>If they can't show you what they do with your inputs then they can't be trusted.</em></em></p>\n<p>But, this mentality of \"software should respect my privacy\" severely limits the things I try. When I was young and carefree <em><em>I am still young, but not carefree.</em></em> I used to try every new thing that I came across, no matter what it was, what philosophy it followed, what it did to my data, no matter anything. But, now I don't do that.</p>\n<p>If I try to test things, I feel bad, I feel like I am going against my belief system, against my personality. Because most of the products that come out, doesn't tick my boxes.\nThey might be proprietary, or by some big tech, or having many trackers, or collecting too much data, asking for my personal information etc. <em><em>It doesn't feel like a problem, right? I mean, it's a good thing to be conscious.</em></em></p>\n<p>But, I miss trying out every new thing that came out. I used to make an account for everything as soon as I knew about them. I used to sign up for beta/alpha testing for random projects. But, now a days I am hating on things I haven't even tried or used. I first judge them by the cover, then by their licence and only by what they can do.</p>\n<p>I loved <em><em>still do</em></em> change, I yearned for things to change very often. Holding grudges and being \"in the state of unhappiness for a long time\" wasn't something I did, or wanted to do and it's something I am feeling very often now-a-days. It was because I didn't care about \"many people\" I only cared and thought about the one I was interacting to. But, now when I am surrounded by many people and they know me by some way, it is very difficult to suddenly move on from something I have been caused harm by to feeling no dislike/hatred toward it.</p>\n<p>All I am trying to say is that things seem to be more permanent and fragile these days. But before, I used to quickly fix things up if things happened, like it was clay with just a minor fixable dent.</p>\n<p><em><em>But now, the idea of fixing things up before it became permanent, seems weak and insecure, without confidence, without resilience, without personality.</em></em></p>\n<p><em><em>When does confidence turn into stubbornness? I don't want to look like a \"Coward\" who keeps changing their mind and forgetting and forgiving the bad things and betrayals they have faced. I want to be bold. But, when does boldness turn into resentment, estrangement or just that other English word that convey the exact meaning but I don't know it.</em></em></p>\n<p><em><em>Or maybe I have gotten the meaning of cowardice all wrong. Well, it's something I haven't learned from books but from friends, family, and society.</em></em></p>\n<p><em><em>Well that was a tangent!</em></em></p>\n<p>I sometimes want to give up on privacy and try every new thing that comes up in the internet. Then the guilt kicks in and I just cannot do it, especially if it requires a login. Previously, I used to log in with my pseudonym everywhere. But nowadays I have fallen back to using my real name and primary email for people in the masses because I see other people not caring much about their real name being in use. <em><em>I don't know where I got the idea that my real name should not be in the internet, maybe it felt stealthy.</em></em></p>\n<p>And in the search for the perfect thing, I am losing out on many steppingstones to reach a valid goal.\nI don't like C#, or Flutter or React Native because of big tech. I always liked C because it was what the kernel was written in and is the mother of all languages.\nBut, I am most attracted by rust and beyond rust there are not many languages that attract me apart from the uniqueness and \"stealthiness\" of languages like Haskell and Lisp.\nI don't like C++ for no reason at all because I have heard many people bashing on C++ and telling how great rust is, so why would I learn a language that is hated a lot.\nI want to know the things in low level yet I struggle even in highest of levels, I sometimes even struggle in \"bash\".\nSomething I got into unknowingly, Linux, is something I quiet understand. So, there is an example there, if I hadn't struggled in Linux in the first place I wouldn't have the capacity to understand at the level that I do now.</p>\n<p>Maybe my personality of immediately showing off the things I have done to people isn't a great thing as a personality. Because, I tend to do it only if I can finish it quickly and show it off. The lack of patience is my motivation to be fast but the motivation to do things fast comes with the cost of not being to learn the things with a steep learning curve.\n<em><em>This makes me feel like I have reached the edge and I cannot jump to the other side because it's too far. And I don't have the willpower to go all the way around the cliff since I have come this far.</em></em> I think I should swallow my pride and keep quiet for some time. But, will it help?</p>\n<p><em><em>The problem seems to be seeking external validation after all.</em></em> One way to still showcase and learn may be documenting the process of learning something. But, I fear spending more time documenting and less time actually learning the thing. <em><em>Why I am worrying about spending more time documenting? Because I feel like I have wasted so much time that I need to now compensate the time I have lost, which isn't helping.</em></em></p>\n<p>I shall \"invest\" time now.</p>","published":"2025-08-08T17:43:01+00:00","published_ts":1754674981},"activity":{"type":"link"},"target":"https://flux.carboxi.de/creation-consumption-trying-testing/"}]}
