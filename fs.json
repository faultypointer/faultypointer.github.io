I've narrowed it down\nto a few areas like\n- Algorithm Design\n- Programming Language Theory and Compiler Design\n- Operating Systems\n\nThey are very big fields each having a large numbers of areas within themselves to choose from.\nHopefully I can narrow my interest down to just one before graduating.
